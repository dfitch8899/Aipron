## 🏗️ Architecture

AIpron is built as a monorepo with:

- **Mobile App** (Primary): React Native + Expo
- **Web App** (Secondary): Next.js 14
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI Realtime API (GPT-4o Realtime)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Simple)

You can run AIpron in **two modes**:
- **Full stack** (backend + mobile app)
- **UI only** (mobile web preview, no backend / DB required)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **v18+** installed
- An OpenAI API key (optional if you just want to see the UI)

---

### Option A – UI only (fastest preview, no backend/DB)

This lets you see and play with the mobile UI in your browser.

1. **Install mobile dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Aipron\mobile
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Expo Web**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Aipron\mobile
   npx expo start --web
   ```

3. In the Expo terminal, press:
   - `w` to open the web preview

4. Your browser should now show the **Chat screen UI**.

> Note: In this mode, calls to the backend (recipe generation, pantry, etc.) will fail if the backend isn’t running, but the UI will still render.

---

### Option B – Full stack (backend + mobile UI)

This gives you API + UI together.

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd C:\Aipron\backend
npm install

# Mobile
cd C:\Aipron\mobile
npm install
```

#### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
cd C:\Aipron\backend
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `backend/.env` and set:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your real OpenAI API key  
- You can leave `DATABASE_URL` and others as-is for now if you’re just testing; DB-dependent endpoints may fail, but the server will still start.

#### 3. Start the backend

```bash
cd C:\Aipron\backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
- `🚀 Server running on port 3001`

#### 4. Configure the mobile app

```bash
cd C:\Aipron\mobile
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `mobile/.env`:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

#### 5. Start the mobile app (web preview)

```bash
cd C:\Aipron\mobile
npx expo start --web
```

Then:
- Press `w` in the terminal to open the app in your browser.

You should now see the mobile **Chat UI** running in your browser, hitting the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.
